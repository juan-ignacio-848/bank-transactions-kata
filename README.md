# Authorizer
I chose to solve this problem using Clojure. The reasons for doing this were the following:

 - Clojure is a data oriented language and so seemed the problem to me.
 - I think Clojure makes me write simpler and more expressive code.  Nevertheless, there's always room for improvement and suggestions.
 - Writing in Clojure is fun :)
